# Blockchain-Simulator
SDEV 200 Final Project
By: Nicholas Baird


Here is my Final Project for my Java Development Class. It is supposed to simulate a cryptocurrency blockchain. You are able to create a cryptocurrency to make your blockchain run off of, then within the blockchain you can create Holder's and Miner's. The Holder's and Miner's are able to send transactions between each other. Once you mine a block with one of the Miner's selected, the new block will display all of the transactions that have happened in between the last block and now new block. There will also be a reward for the miner mining the block stated in the block.
